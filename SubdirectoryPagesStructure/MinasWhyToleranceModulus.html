    <h1>Why Tolerance/Mina's Modulus</h1>
    <div class="discovery-details">
    <p>A constant value different for each person, it represents the ratio of
        "Why questions" that one can respond to in a reasonable manner before being incapable of doing so, 
        relative to other people. This value is useful for any given why question with a known why level,
        the why level is proportional to the number of why questions one can answer for a given why tolerance value.
        <br> Note: Why Level determines the question's tolerance of being asked a why for which an answer 
        with reasonability can be given, for example "Why are you like this?" has a high why level since "Why" can be asked many times "
        before running out of answers.
        An example of question with low Why Level would be something like "Why was the world created?" where
        the number of why's asked with reasonable answers beyond that will be extremely limited, if 0 why's can be asked then the why level is 0
        <br>General example: If Why Tolerance Modulus for person x = 0.8 and person y = 0.4, and the why
        level = 65, the number of answers person x
        can give to why's beyond the first question will be 2 times greater than that of person y 
        <br>Detailed example: 
        <br>Question: "Why is grass green"
        <br>Person y answer: "Because it contains chlorophyll" 
        <br>Why 1: "Why is chlorophyll green?"
        <br>Person y answer: "Since the wavelength of light reflects from chlorophyll is green"
        <br>Why 2: "Why is that so?"
        <br>Person y answer: "Ask God not me"
        <br>
        <br><font size="6">Alternatively</font>
        <br>
        <br>Question: "Why is grass green"
        <br>Person x answer: "Because it contains chlorophyll" 
        <br>Why 1: "Why is chlorophyll green?"
        <br>Person x answer: "Since the wavelength of light reflects from chlorophyll is green"
        <br>Why 2: "Why is that so?"
        <br>Person x answer: "The molecular structure of chlorophyll causes it to absorb
        red and blue light but prevents it from absorbing green light causing it to be reflected"
        <br>Why 3: "Why is the molecular structure of the chlorophyll shaped like that?"
        <br>Person x answer: "Thats just how it works, now leave me alone!"
        <br>
        <br>Since person x has double the Why Tolerance modulus of person y, they can answer double the
        number of why questions beyond the original questions with reasonable answers 
        (in this case 2 instead of 1). The first question does not count since if it had no answer,
        its why level would be 0 making the why tolerance modulus of the people answering irrelevant.
        <br><b>*A formula to show this relation will be created but a constant might need to be compiled first*</b>
        <div class="more-details">
          <p>
            <br>Progress with the formula:
            <br>ùúè (lowercase tau in greek) is the symbol for why tolerance
            <br>ùúè does change slightly change as age and therefore knowledge of the individual increases
            but this must cancel out since this change in knowledge, relative to other people with the same change
            in knowlege means that ùúè, a value that shows the difference in why tolerance <b>relative</b> to people,
            must mean the effects of the change eliminate each other
            <br>This also means that in an overly simplified manner, Knowledge is equal to a constant 
            (that is also an oversimplification of the factors that affect knowledge) that is specific to each person
            must be used to calculate the knowledge "factor" of a person. For clarity, let knowledge factor = Œ¶ (Phi), 
            knowledge = k, age=a. Given that, k must equal ab (k = aŒ¶). 
            <br>For the effect of age to cancel out, the a's in the formula must eliminate each other
            so ùúè is proportional to k/a which is equal to aŒ¶/a
            <br>So ùúè is proportional to knowledge k, the number of valid why answers y, and is inversely proportional to 
            why level of question L. 
            <br>therefore: ùúè = k/aL = aŒ¶/aL = Œ¶/L
            <br><b>Plan for what is left to do:</b>
            <ul><li>find how to calculate L</li>
            <li>Find a way to calculate Œ¶ for a person</li>
            <li>Find any missing relations for ùúè</li></ul>
