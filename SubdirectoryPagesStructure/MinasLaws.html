      <h2>Mina's General Laws</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Life will always be worse than it is good, if you think about it enough. 
          <br>(|Good|-|Bad| < 0, ie |Good|>|Bad|)
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Note: Either get alone with the fact that it is objectively bad, or just don't think about it </li>
          </ul></li>        
        <li>If smth good, A, with magnitude A Vals, has happened/is happening, something bad, with magnitude B Vals (where B>=A), willÂ happen
        <br>(Basically if something good happens, something equal or greater in magnitude bad, B, will happen.)
          <ul><li>Vals is a measure of good/bad, negative Vals is Bad and positive Vals is good
          <br>eg. 5 Vals is good, -6 Vals is bad, and the net Val is 0, so in this system, the net Val is 5-6=-1
          </li></ul></li>
        <li>Good cannot be created nor destroyed</li>
        <li>Bad can be both created and destroyed</li>
        <li>Entropy of bad is always increasing, whilst good maintains a constant average
          <ul><li>Basically the "density" of bad is always decreasing, so bad is being constantly 
            dissipated away from the world, and good is on average the same in the world</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you sense that something bad is going to happen then it will, sooner or later
          <ul>
            <li>Note: It is better when you expect it since instead of being affected by both the shock resulting from the event occurring and its effects,
            you are only affected by the latter</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Mina's Laws of Electronics</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The components you need at the moment are the ones you don't have and cannot get in a single day</li>
        <li>You never have all the components you need to finish a basically-complete project</li>
        <li>To be continued</li>
      </ol>
