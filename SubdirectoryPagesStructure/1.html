    <h1>Why Tolerance/Mina's Modulus</h1>
    <div class="discovery-details">
    <p>A constant value different for each person, it represents the ratio of
        "Why questions" that one can respond to in a reasonable manner before being incapable of doing so, 
        relative to other people. This value is useful for any given why question with a known why level,
        the why level is proportional to the number of why questions one can answer for a given why tolerance value.
        <br> Note: Why Level determines the question's tolerance of being asked a why for which an answer 
        with reasonability can be given, for example "Why are you like this?" has a high why level since "Why" can be asked many times "
        before running out of answers.
        An example of question with low Why Level would be something like "Why was the world created?" where
        the number of why's asked with reasonable answers beyond that will be extremely limited, if 0 why's can be asked then the why level is 0
        <br>General example: If Why Tolerance Modulus for person x = 0.8 and person y = 0.4, and the why
        level = 65, the number of answers person x
        can give to why's beyond the first question will be 2 times greater than that of person y 
        <br>Detailed example: 
        <br>Question: "Why is grass green"
        <br>Person y answer: "Because it contains chlorophyll" 
        <br>Why 1: "Why is chlorophyll green?"</p>
        <br>Person y answer: "Since the wavelength of light reflects from chlorophyll is green"
        <br>Why 2: "Why is that so?"
        <br>Person y answer: "Ask God not me"
        <br>
        <br><font size="6">Alternatively</font>
        <br>
        <br>Question: "Why is grass green"
        <br>Person x answer: "Because it contains chlorophyll" 
        <br>Why 1: "Why is chlorophyll green?"
        <br>Person x answer: "Since the wavelength of light reflects from chlorophyll is green"
        <br>Why 2: "Why is that so?"
        <br>Person x answer: "The molecular structure of chlorophyll causes it to absorb
        red and blue light but prevents it from absorbing green light causing it to be reflected"
        <br>Why 3: "Why is the molecular structure of the chlorophyll shaped like that?"
        <br>Person x answer: "Thats just how it works, now leave me alone!"
        <br>
        <br>Since person x has double the Why Tolerance modulus of person y, they can answer double the
        number of why questions beyond the original questions with reasonable answers 
        (in this case 2 isntead of 1). The first question does not count since if it had no answer,
        its why level would be 0 making the why tolerance modulus of the people answering insignificant.
        <br>A formula to show this relation will be created but a constant might need to be discovered first
