    <p>A constant value different for each person, it represents the ratio of
        "Why questions" that one can respond to in a reasonable manner before being incapable of doing so, 
        relative to other people. This value is useful for any given why question with a known why level,
        the why level is proportional to the number of why questions one can answer for a given why tolerance value.
        <br> Note: Why Level determines the question's tolerance of being asked a why for which an answer 
        with reasonability can be given, for example "Why are you like this?" has a high why level since "Why" can be asked many times "
        before running out of answers.
        An example of question with low Why Level would be something like "Why was the world created?" where
        the number of why's asked beyond that will be extremely limited, if 0 why's can be asked then the why level is 0
        <br>Eg. If Why Tolerance Modulus for person x=0.9 and person y=0.4, when given a single level.. tbc... </p>
